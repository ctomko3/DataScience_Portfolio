# Analyzing NCAA Tournament Teams Using Logistic Regression
This model outputs a user interface using R Shiny that allows users to select two team statistics to analyze a logistic regression model's ability to correctly predict which NCAA teams would make the tournament. The user interface returns both training and testing accuracy for both of the selected features and each feature as well as visual aids to help understand the binary classification that is occurring.

The link to the R Shiny application can be found below. Please make sure to select two features for the model and then press 'Submit.' The application will not work unless this step is completed.
