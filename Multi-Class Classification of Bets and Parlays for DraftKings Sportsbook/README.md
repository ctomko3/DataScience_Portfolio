## Multi-Class Classification of Bets and Parlays for DraftKings Sportsbook

In this Major Qualifying Project (MQP), the team partnered with DraftKings Sportsbook to generate user-specific single bet and parlay predictions. To accomplish this, the team utilized clustering algorithms and evaluation methods to group users together. Multi-class classification algorithms including Linear Support Vector, Naïve Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and a neural network were then used to predict the most likely associations between bets/parlays and groups of users from the best clustering algorithm. The neural network classifier provided the best prediction performance and significantly outperformed random classification as well as classification to the most popular cluster. This project’s goal was to help DraftKings create a more personalized experience for their users by more accurately associating potential bets and parlays with each user. 

Due to the confidentiality of the work, the specifics of the project are not shared, but I have provided the final poster presentation (see link below) that the team created for WPI Project Presentation Day. The team was awarded 3rd place for all data science projects.
