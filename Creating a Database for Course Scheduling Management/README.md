## Creating a Database for COurse Scheduling Management
  The business problem the group has recognized is that a school is struggling to keep track of the data revolving around its professors, students, and the various courses offered after switching the system the school operates on. Professors have ended up being assigned to courses outside of their department, which they are not qualified to teach. Multiple courses are being assigned to the same room at the same time, leaving the issue of which group of people have the room booked. To add to the issues, studentâ€™s schedules have been changing and many courses being taken now conflict. This is causing both the students and professors frustration as there have been many mistakes recently. The school is increasingly becoming more disappointed with the new system and irritated as employees have had to work even harder to try to accommodate both the students and professors. Overall, the implementation of the new system created massive chaos in the school community.
